In Code Automation we will focus on managing model configurations,
initial and boundary conditions files,
forcing files,
model runs,
and run results files.
We'll use version control tools and scripting in Bash and Python to work in the file and run management framework to make model runs efficient and reproducible so that the focus of research stays on gaining insight from model runs.
