Doug Latornell is a professional engineer with post-graduate degrees in experimental and computational fluid mechanics and modeling and control of robotic manipulators.
He works with the Mesoscale Ocean and Atmosphere Dynamics (MOAD) group at the University of British Columbia as a Research Software Engineer and as a freelance software developer.
With the MOAD group he has developed a collection of software automation tools to help researchers run the NEMO ocean model easily and reproducibly on platforms ranging from laptops and local workstations to cloud and HPC clusters.
He has also developed a software automation framework for running the NEMO model as a research operational system - daily model runs with the most up-to-date available surface forcing and open boundary conditions from real-time data sources and other operational model product web services such as Environment Canada, Mercator Ocean, and Live Ocean.
High resolution ocean models on both the Pacific (Salish Sea) and Atlantic (Gulf of Maine and Scotian Shelf) coasts are presently using that framework to produce daily nowcast/forecast runs.
Doug is a Software Carpentry instructor and is the maintainer of the SWC Version Control with Mercurial lesson.
